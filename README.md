### Overview

Playground created during first try of dealing with NestJS.

Interfaces: 
- Post entity
- REST: get/get many/create endpoint
- GraphQL (code first): get/get many queries,create mutation

REST and GraphQL interfaces doing the same things and use the same PostsService and Post DTO. <br>
Made for PoC: server may use both of them without code mess.

Infrastructure:
- NestJS App
- SQLite DB

Also includes index page and common file upload endpoint. <br>
Nothing interesting, just a test.
